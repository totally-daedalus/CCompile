# CCompile
Compile C++ with less typing.

**Please note that this only works on linux**
# Why Use This?
You really shouldn't. It's unnecessary, and buggy.

But if you really want to, it has some features.

First, you can type less. Inside of this `g++ file.cpp -o a; ./a` it becomes `c file.cpp`.

Second, it immediately runs the executable.

Third, it deletes the executable when done executing.
# How To Install
First, install g++ by running `sudo apt install g++`

Second, download the compiled version, then drag the compiled version to /usr/bin/
# How To Use
Just like g++ but without `-o "some file name"`
