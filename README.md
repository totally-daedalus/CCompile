# CCompile
Compile C++ with less typing.

**Please note that this only works on linux.**
# Why Use This?
You really shouldn't. It's unnecessary, and buggy.

But if you really want to, it has some features.

1. You can type less. Instead of this `g++ file.cpp -o a; ./a` it becomes `c file.cpp`.
2. It immediately runs the executable.
3. It deletes the executable when done executing.
# How To Install
First, install g++ by running `sudo apt install g++`

Second, download the compiled version, then drag the compiled version to /usr/bin/
# How To Use
Just like g++ but without `-o "some file name"` and `./executable`
